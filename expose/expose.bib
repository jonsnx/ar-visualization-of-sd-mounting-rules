  abstract = {The effectiveness of different camera images for mobile robot teleoperation
	is investigated. During a robot teleoperation where the operator
	can only control the robot through observing the camera images rather
	than direct-view control, the information provided by the images
	must be sufficient enough to allow the operator to perform the remote
	control efficiently. In order to understand which kind of camera
	images are most effective for robot teleoperation, we have conducted
	several experiments to examine their validness. The experimental
	results indicated that an image where the robot is positioned in
	the center of the camera view with clear survey of the surroundings
	shows high efficiency in remote control of a mobile robot.},
