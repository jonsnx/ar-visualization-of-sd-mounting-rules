@misc{Mostafa.2019,
 abstract = {So I am using session({\_} session: ARSession, didAdd anchors: [ARAnchor] to get all detected planes (I cannot use renderer({\_} renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, didAdd node: SCNNode, for anchor: ARAnchor) Because I am using RealityKit instead of ARKit).

So my question is, How can I get the rotation of the detected anchor from this method? I want to create a plane Entity that has exactly the same position, size, orientation {\&} rotation of the detected anchor. So far Im using the extent for the size, center for position but I can't figure out how to get the rotation. Because right now Its detected correctly (Right position and size)but with wrong rotation that the real plane.},
